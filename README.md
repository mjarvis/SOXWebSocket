SOXWebSocket
============

SOXWebSocket is a conforming WebSocket client library for Objective-C applications. It is meant to be a slimmer, faster, near drop in replacement for [SocketRocket](https://github.com/square/SocketRocket)

This project is in its infancy, however, it passes all of the same [AutoBahn](http://www.tavendo.de/autobahn/testsuite.html) tests as SocketRocket, with 4 UTF-8 tests being non-strict passes.

Any and all contributions are welcome! See the TODO list below or Issues to decide where to get started.

TODO
====
* Extend README (examples, features, etc)
* Create Example Project
* Create Tests target in Example project to run AutoBahn tests
* Improve code readability
* Improve customizability of URL request
